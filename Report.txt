Part 1. 
Answer 1. We have structured our design as follows
		Control logic blocks - memory_control_xf (same control logic for both memories)
							   conv_control (control logic for the datapath)
		Datapath - convolutioner (Performs the covolution operations)

Answer a. Arithematic operations required for 8x4 convolution
Multiplication - 4
Addition - 4
Number of iterations - 5
Total number of arithematic operations = (Multiplications + Additions) * No of Iterations
									   = (4 + 4) * 5
									   = 40 Arithematic operations
Genaralization of number of arithematic operations
Number of multiplications depends only of length of f which is M
Number of additions is dependant on number of multiplications which is again M
For one complete convolution operation on vector x of length N and vector f of length M we need
N - M + 1 iterations. Hence the total number
